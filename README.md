In search of a sustainable and transparent adblocker for the survival of the free internet.

Hello World,

We are Magnetron Media (Microwave Media) from the Netherlands and we believe in a evenly balanced free internet, a world where online advertising and adblocking goes hand-in-hand. A lot of the free content as we know it is funded by online ad revenues, especially for the independent publishers among us. On the other hand the sheer quantity and variety of online advertisements got completely out of hand for lets say the past 10 years or so. We should accept the fact that advertising is among us and always will be around us in modern day society. What we shouldn't accept are the rules online advertising is creating for us, we should be in charge setting the rules, for example I could experience an ad as annoying or disruptive whether another person could experience the same ad as funny or helpful or not experiencing the ad at all! Helpfull guidelines have already been set by the internet, the 'acceptable ads manifesto' is one of those guidelines. We at Magnetron Media are a big fan of this manifesto and want to support the manifesto with a sustainable and transparent adblocker which collects quantitative data sets of (anonymous) individual users for better advertising AND the best online user-experience when it comes to speed and privacy. An adblocker for the survival of the free internet and better advertising, a win-win situation for both sides. 

Well, enough chatter. Let's get to the point. We at Magnetron Media have built an innovative concept around adblocking software which we would like to discuss with you guys, the programmers/coders around the world. Our concept is built so that each and every individual user can set it's own rules according to exposure of online advertising, the concept mostly revolves around big data collection and analysis. Since we are not that into the technical side of things but more into the problem solving/concept building part of things we would like to ask for you help and advice.

We believe that our concept can truly change the entire landscape of online advertising once built and implemented correctly. If you also believe in a free open internet where adblocking and online advertising go hand in hand, please do contact us via email. (mwaard1@avans.nl) 

Sincerely, Magnetron Media.
